# EasyCheckup
This is an application coded primarily by myself and designed by my team of 3, for the coding challenge segment of the Lassonde Games Tri-hackathon!

The challenge was to design and develop a software system to improve the autonomy and accessibility of healthcare among the senior population in Toronto's waterfront district (in the year 2030), that is planned to be a technology, startup and tourist hub.

Our design idea was to allow a doctor to send out daily (or every other day) yes/no type surveys to the their senior patients. The survey questions would be based on medicine the patient is taking (as seniors typically have up to 5 medicines perscribed, symptom tracking can be tough). An example question would be "Have you expereinced any diahrrea?" or "Any fatigue?". After the survey is complete, the answers would be uploaded to a database to then allow researchers and doctors to make better diagnoses regarding medicine, as well as ensure no serious suedo serious symptoms are taking place (diahrrea), which would show a flag on the patients name.

Our application will help the healthcare space as having a better understanding of senior patients will lead better quality health care overall for seniors during checkups. Seniors also having peace of mind that they are being looked after in real-time while prescribed with countless medicines is also a benefit for mental health.

Machine learning algorithms could be trained on this data to ensure the right medicine is being diagnosed for the patient (looks at allergy history, previous serious symptoms). At the moment, the design mainly revolves around medicine, but this is easily scalable to dental care, cancer patients, surgery and much more. The design intends on revolutionizing health care with the power of data science.
